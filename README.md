### About the Dataset:
The [Breast Cancer Diagnostic data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This database is also available through the [UW CS ftp server](http://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/cancer/WDBC/).

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].


**Attribute Information**:
- ID number
- Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

1. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
2. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
3. perimeter 
4. area 
5. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
6. compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
7. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
8. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9. symmetry
10. fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

Missing attribute values: none

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
